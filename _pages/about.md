I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Biostatistics at Yale University, working with [Dr. Hongyu Zhao](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/hongyu-zhao/). Previously, I completed my PhD in Statistics at Texas A&M University under the supervision of [Dr. Yang Ni](https://nystat.github.io/yni/). I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from the School of Mathematics and Statistics at Wuhan University.

I work on general methods related to graphical models, causal discovery, causal inference, and Bayesian statistics. My research interests also include developing statistical methods to solve problems in genomics, neuroscience, and precision medicine.
