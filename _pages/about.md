I am currently a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Biostatistics at Yale University, working with [Dr. Hongyu Zhao](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/hongyu-zhao/). Previously, I completed my PhD in Statistics at Texas A&M University, advised by [Dr. Yang Ni](https://nystat.github.io/yni/). I received my undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Statistics from the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University.

I work on general methods related to graphical models, causal discovery, causal inference, and Bayesian statistics. My research interests also include developing statistical methods to solve problems in genomics, neuroscience, and precision medicine.
