Latent variables and cycles are common in real-world systems but often overlooked. Directed acyclic graphs are popular for their well-understood properties and learning algorithms, but their assumptions are restrictive. Directed mixed graphs and cyclic graphs provide better representations of real-world data-generating processes, but their theoretical properties and learning algorithms remain under-explored.
