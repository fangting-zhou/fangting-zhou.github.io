Causal structure learning has been widely studied in the literature. However, most existing work focuses on continuous data with relatively simple structures, which reduces their relevance in complex, real-world scenarios. For instance, multivariate categorical data are commonly encountered in domains such as survey data and clinical records. The goal is to extend causal structure learning to accommodate discrete and mixed data while accounting for potential spatial-temporal patterns.
