Bayesian methods are well-recognized for their strong performance in low-sample settings and for their ability to quantify uncertainty, which is crucial for various causal inference tasks, including the design of interventional experiments. However, despite these advantages, Bayesian methods face great computational challenges, particularly in the context of causal structure learning. Scaling the problem to datasets with more than a few hundred variables without imposing constraints remains demanding, and many sampling algorithms struggle with mixing issues.
