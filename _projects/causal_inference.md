Most significant loci identified in genome-wide association studies are located in non-coding regions of the genome, with likely regulatory functions. This underscores the importance of characterizing molecular mediators that connect genotypes to disease phenotypes. Furthermore, many regulatory effects are tissue- or cell-type dependent and involve the complex interplay of multiple biological processes. This necessitates leveraging multi-tissue, multi-omics, and single-cell data to deepen our understanding of the genetic basis of complex diseases.
